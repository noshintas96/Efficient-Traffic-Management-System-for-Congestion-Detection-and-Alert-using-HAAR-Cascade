# Efficient Traffic Management System with HAAR Cascade

This project focuses on developing an efficient traffic management system for congestion detection and alert using the HAAR Cascade algorithm. The system aims to detect traffic congestion in real-time and alert authorities to take necessary actions for traffic management.

Congestion Detection: The HAAR Cascade algorithm is utilized to detect congestion by analyzing live traffic footage or images captured from surveillance cameras.

## Implementation:

HAAR Cascade Training: Train the HAAR Cascade classifier using a labeled dataset of congested and uncongested traffic images.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model to analyze live traffic footage or images obtained from surveillance cameras.

## Conclusion:

The Efficient Traffic Management System with HAAR Cascade offers a reliable solution for congestion detection and alerting. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, the system contributes to improved traffic management and enhanced safety on roads.
